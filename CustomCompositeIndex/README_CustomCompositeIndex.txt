Custom Composite Index Plugin for SpectrononPro

The Custom Composite Index Plugin for SpectrononPro is specifically engineered to assist agricultural scientists in conducting advanced analysis of hyperspectral imaging data. By calculating a composite index from four selected spectral bands, this plugin becomes a critical tool for in-depth examination of plant health, soil composition, and crop monitoring. It employs a sophisticated yet straightforward formula to provide a comprehensive view of agricultural conditions.

Features

Flexible Band Selection: Users can select four distinct spectral bands for the composite index calculation.

Composite Index Calculation: The plugin computes the composite index using the formula: Composite Index = (Band0 - Band1) / (Band2 / Band3)â€‹
 
Customized for Agriculture: Tailored for use in agricultural science, facilitating research in crop health and land assessment.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy to integrate and use within the SpectrononPro software.
