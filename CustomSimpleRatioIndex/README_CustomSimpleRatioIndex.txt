Custom Simple Ratio Index Plugin for SpectrononPro

The Custom Simple Ratio Index Plugin is a specialized tool for SpectrononPro, designed to calculate a simple ratio index for hyperspectral imaging data. This plugin facilitates the analysis of hyperspectral images by allowing users to select specific spectral bands and compute their simple ratio. The index is particularly useful in applications like vegetation monitoring, agricultural analysis, and environmental studies.

Features

Band Selection: Users can choose two specific bands from hyperspectral data for index calculation.
Simple Ratio Calculation: Computes the ratio of the reflectance values of the selected bands.
Flexible Application: Suitable for various hyperspectral datasets, including agricultural and environmental studies.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use within the SpectrononPro environment.
